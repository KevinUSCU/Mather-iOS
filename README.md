# Mather-iOS
Ultra-basic iOS front-end connecting to mather-tdd backend api as proof of concept.

This app has a text input field and a spinner input field. Each allows inputting a number. On hitting a submit button, those two numbers will be passed to the server API /addem route. The returned result is displayed on the iOS screen.

I am practicing building an iOS app from scratch, allowing user input, making API calls, and parsing the result.
